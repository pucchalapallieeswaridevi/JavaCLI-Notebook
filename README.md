# 💳 Java CLI Notebook

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Java command-line application** designed to simulate a simple notebook system where users can manage text entries.  
It’s a great starting point for beginners to understand **Java basics** along with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

With this application, you can create new notes, view all saved notes, delete specific notes, and exit the program — all from your terminal.
